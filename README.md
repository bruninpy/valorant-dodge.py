## ‚ùî How to use

- Download this application
- Wait 30 seconds for the build to be fully done.
- Click ONE Time on the .exe ( If you spam it, it won't work and will give errors. )
- Start VALORANT and this app.
- Now click dodge and you will have successfully dodged. ( If you try to use it outside of a pre-game, it won't work. )
- Optionally, it's recommended to have [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_in/chrome/) installed. The .exe will simply open in your default browser otherwise, but it will still work.

## ‚ùå Windows protected your PC
The application might refuse to run because Windows will assume this is malicious.
<br>
The fix is pretty simple, click on `More Info` and click on `Run Anyway`
<br>
Is that safe? Yes, it is. Windows protects your PC because this is an unsigned executable from an external source. If you're feeling a little paranoid, you can build it yourself with the instructions below!

## ‚ùì Can I get banned?

No, only if you say that you use an external program that messes with the API.
<br>
Even if Riot happens to somehow detect this, you will only recieve a 7 day ban for API abuse. That's still unlikely to occur and hasn't happened yet.
